"question": "Find the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ...",
"options": ["85", "90", "95", "100"],
"answerIndex": 2,
"explanation": "The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number. Substituting the given values, we get a_10 = 2 + 9(3) = 29. The sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence is given by the formula: S_n = n/2(a_1 + a_n). Substituting the given values, we get S_10 = 10/2(2 + 29) = 95. Therefore, the correct option is 95."

"question": "What is the nth term of the geometric sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ...?",
"options": ["2^(n-1)", "2^n", "3^(n-1)", "3^n"],
"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by the formula: a_n = a_1 r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number. Dividing consecutive terms of the given sequence, we get: 6/2 = 3, 18/6 = 3, 54/18 = 3, and so on. Therefore, the common ratio is 3. Substituting a_1 = 2 and r = 3 into the formula, we get a_n = 2*3^(n-1). Therefore, the correct option is 2^n."

"explanation": "The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula: S_n = a_1(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), where a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Substituting the given values, we get S_20 = 5(1 - 2^20)/(1 - 2) = 10485750. Therefore, the correct option is 10485750."
